# CPlusPlusCodes
Introduction to Computer Programming

Hi all,
These are a list of problems and project i undertook in my journey to learn the world of computer programming
All the codes are written for C++ 14.

I was a mechanical engineering student who found his true passion in computer programming
Decided to swap to CSE by mid of 3rd year 2nd sem and started preparation work during my 4th year semester 1
