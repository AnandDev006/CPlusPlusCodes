# CPlusPlusCodes
Introduction to Computer Programming

Hi all,
These are a list of problems and project i undertook in my journey to learn the world of computer programming
All the codes are written for C++ 14 and using CLion IDE https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/

I was a mechanical engineering student ( not by choice ) who found his true passion in computer programming
Decided to swap to CSE by mid of 3rd year 2nd sem and started preparation work during my 4th year semester 1
